# Rillow is a simple ruby wrapper to zillow webservice api: http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm
# It does the web service call and gets the result back for you.  You don't have to know about the url request formate, url encoding or 
# parsing the result.  The result object is in hash/array format.  So no need to parse xml.
# You will need to register with zillow to get the Zillow Web Service Identifier first.
# Go to http://rubyforge.org/projects/rillow/ for project details or to download the latest release
# Installation:
# gem install rillow
# Example code:
# require 'rubygems'
# require 'rillow'
# rillow = Rillow.new('your-zillow-key')
# result = rillow.get_search_results('2114 Bigelow Ave','Seattle, WA')
# result.to_hash
